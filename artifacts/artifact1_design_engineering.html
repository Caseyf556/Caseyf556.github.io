<h1>Software Design & Engineering Enhancement</h1>

<h2>Artifact Description</h2>
<p>
For this enhancement, I selected my ClickedItemActivity.java file from my Android development coursework. The original version displayed text when a user clicked an item, but it lacked user‑friendly features and visual polish. The activity worked, but it felt plain and did not provide a smooth user experience. This made it a strong candidate for enhancement because it allowed me to demonstrate improvements in UI/UX design and mobile development practices.
</p>

<h2>Justification for Inclusion</h2>
<p>
I included this artifact because it clearly shows my growth in software design and engineering. I added a fade‑in animation, improved text sizing, and implemented user comments to make the code more readable and maintainable. These enhancements demonstrate my ability to improve an existing mobile interface, apply design principles, and create a more engaging user experience.
</p>

<h2>Course Outcomes Met</h2>
<p>
This enhancement supports Course Outcome 1 by demonstrating my ability to design and engineer software solutions that improve usability and maintainability. It also supports Course Outcome 4 by applying well‑founded techniques and tools to enhance the software. The improvements show my understanding of mobile UI design, event handling, and clean coding practices.
</p>

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
Enhancing this artifact helped me better understand how small UI changes can significantly improve the user experience. I learned how to implement animations, adjust layout properties, and write cleaner, more maintainable code. This process strengthened my confidence in Android development and reinforced the importance of thoughtful design decisions.
