<h1>Algorithms & Data Structures Enhancement</h1>

<h2>Artifact Description</h2>
<p>
For this enhancement, I selected my ContactService.java file from CS‑320. The original version stored contacts in an ArrayList and used linear searches for every operation. This worked for small datasets but became inefficient as the number of contacts grew. Because of this, the artifact was a great opportunity to demonstrate my growth in algorithms and data structures.
</p>

<h2>Justification for Inclusion</h2>
<p>
I included this artifact in my ePortfolio because it shows my ability to analyze an existing solution and improve it using better data structures. I replaced the ArrayList with a HashMap, which allows constant‑time lookups and updates. I also improved validation and cleaned up the update methods to make the code more predictable and easier to maintain.
</p>

<h2>Course Outcomes Met</h2>
<p>
This enhancement helped me meet Course Outcome 3 by applying algorithmic principles to design a more efficient solution. It also supported Course Outcome 4 because I used well‑founded techniques and tools to improve the software. The enhancement aligned well with the goals I set earlier in the course.
</p>

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
During the enhancement process, I learned how much impact the choice of data structure has on performance. Switching to a HashMap required rethinking how the program stored and accessed data, but it resulted in a cleaner and faster solution. I also learned the importance of balancing optimization with readability. Testing each operation helped me make sure the new structure didn’t break existing functionality. Overall, this enhancement strengthened my understanding of algorithms and data structures.
