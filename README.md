# Casey Farmer – CS 499 Computer Science ePortfolio

Welcome to my ePortfolio for the CS 499 Computer Science Capstone at Southern New Hampshire University.  
This portfolio brings together the work I completed throughout the program and highlights my growth as a developer. It includes my enhanced artifacts, code review, professional self‑assessment, and supporting files.

The goal of this ePortfolio is to demonstrate my skills in:
- Software design and engineering  
- Algorithms and data structures  
- Databases  
- Testing and validation  
- Communication and documentation  

Each artifact shows how I improved an existing project by applying new techniques, better design decisions, and stronger problem‑solving skills.
