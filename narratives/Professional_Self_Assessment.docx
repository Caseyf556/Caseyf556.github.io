Throughout my Computer Science program and during the development of my ePortfolio, I’ve had the chance to see how much I’ve grown as a developer. The work I completed in this capstone helped me bring together everything I’ve learned, from software design to algorithms, databases, testing, and communication. Building and enhancing my artifacts showed me how these skills connect and how they prepare me for real‑world software development.

One of the biggest strengths I developed in this program is the ability to work with others and communicate clearly. Many of my courses required teamwork, and I learned how to explain my ideas, listen to feedback, and collaborate to solve problems. These skills carried over into my capstone, especially when writing narratives and preparing my code review.

I also strengthened my technical communication skills. Throughout the program, I wrote documentation, explained design decisions, and presented my work in different formats. This helped me learn how to communicate with both technical and non‑technical audiences, which is important in any software role.

In terms of technical skills, I gained a strong foundation in data structures and algorithms. I learned how to choose the right structure for a problem and how those choices affect performance. My enhancement to the ContactService artifact showed how replacing a list with a HashMap can make a big difference in efficiency.

I also built a solid understanding of software engineering practices. I learned how to design clean, maintainable code and how to improve existing projects without breaking them. My mobile app enhancement demonstrated my ability to extend functionality and improve user experience.

Working with databases was another important part of my growth. Integrating SQLite into my ContactService project helped me understand how real applications store, retrieve, and update data. I learned how to design a database schema, write SQL queries, and separate data access logic from business logic. This experience strengthened my ability to build scalable and maintainable systems.

Overall, the artifacts in my ePortfolio show how my skills fit together. Each enhancement represents a different area of computer science, but they all connect to form a complete picture of my abilities. This capstone helped me see how far I’ve come and prepared me to enter the field with confidence.
